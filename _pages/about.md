## About the Site

I created this site because I do encounter tons of stuff everyday and being a fiddler that I am, I end up searching for the weirdest, sometimes geekiest stuff on the internet, which at some point I have to go back to. This is just a place for me to dump all that for myself and whoever happens to stumble upon this.
