Alright, I've had to set up a TeX environment quite a few times, and had to tell people how to do it a couple more so to avoid repeating myself: here it is!

### Windows

First install the TeX *engine*, I use [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download), then you can use it with whatever *editor* you feel like, I like [TeXnicCenter](http://www.texniccenter.org/download/).


### Online

There are several online editors you can use, but by far the most complete is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)

  * Real-time collaboration in your browser
  * Sharing
  * Real-time Preview
  * Rich Text Mode
  * Templates (Papers, slides, CVs&hellip;)


### iPad &amp; OSX

[Texpad](https://www.texpad.com/) is the way to go.
